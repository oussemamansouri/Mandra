The project involves developing a web application dedicated to places to visit in the regions of BÃ©ja, Kef, Siliana, and Jendouba. The application will showcase tourist sites, guest houses, restaurants, hotels, and the gastronomic specialties of these regions. It will also provide contact information for local or rural women.
